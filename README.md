# Singularity definition files

This repo stores various Singularity definition files for building container images that will be used on CARC systems, intended primarily as templates to be modified as needed. The container images need to be built externally, such as through the [Singularity Remote Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/home), and then transferred to CARC systems.
