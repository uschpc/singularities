# Singularity definition files

This repo stores various Singularity definition files to build container images for use on CARC systems, intended primarily as templates to be modified as needed. The definition files include minimal base OS builds as well as various application-specific builds. The container images need to be built externally, such as through the [Singularity Remote Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/home), and then transferred to CARC systems.
